    <h2>Merry Wives of Windsor</h2>
    <h3>Act 1, Scene 1</h3>
    <h4>Windsor. Before PAGE's house</h4>
    <p><i>Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS</i></p>

    <p><b>SHALLOW</b><br> Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.</p>

    <p><b>SLENDER</b><br> In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and 'Coram.'</p>

    <p><b>SHALLOW</b><br> Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.'</p>

    <p><b>SLENDER</b><br> Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born, master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'</p>

    <p><b>SHALLOW</b><br> Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred years.</p>

    <p><b>SLENDER</b><br> All his successors gone before him hath done't; and all his ancestors that come after him may: they may give the dozen white luces in their coat.</p>

    <p><b>SHALLOW</b><br> It is an old coat.</p>

    <p><b>SIR HUGH EVANS</b><br> The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.</p>

    <p><b>SHALLOW</b><br> The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.</p>

    <p><b>SLENDER</b><br> I may quarter, coz.</p>

    <p><b>SHALLOW</b><br> You may, by marrying.</p>

    <p><b>SIR HUGH EVANS</b><br> It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.</p>

    <p><b>SHALLOW</b><br> Not a whit.</p>

    <p><b>SIR HUGH EVANS</b><br> Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures: but that is all one...</p>
